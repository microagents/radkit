description: Understanding the fundamental building blocks of Radkit - threads, content, events, and LLM providers.
---



Radkit is built on a few simple, powerful primitives. Understanding these concepts is key to using the library effectively.

This section covers the fundamental building blocks of Radkit:

-   **[Threads](./threads.md)**: Learn how to represent and manage the history of a conversation with an LLM.
-   **[Content](./content.md)**: Understand how Radkit handles multi-modal message payloads, including text, images, and tool calls.
-   **[Events](./events.md)**: See how individual messages are represented and associated with roles like `user`, `assistant`, and `system`.
-   **[LLM Providers](./llm-providers.md)**: Discover how Radkit provides a unified interface for working with different LLM providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini.
